excerpt: "Work I do"

I really like the idea of working intensely to produce quality work. I have read a couple of hundred excerpts from traditionally successful people telling how they were once deeply
involved in what they were doing and still are. You obviously can't fill your life with asinine "happy" moments, always chasing cheap pleasure over everything else. The character
developed by working hard is parallel to none. Despite knowing all of this, I am becoming lazy day by day. To keep a track of what I do throughout the day, how much genuine work I can produce,
I am thinking of writing here daily. 

Let me jot down a couple of distractions that do not let me work.
First is obviously social media or my phone, the more I look at it, the more I want from it. So I will not be using it.
The urge to check my phone as soon as I wake up is high, but to control it and devote myself to work and only work will produce good results.
Second is I think the concept of breaks. If I am working for let's say 2 hours continuously, this weird sense of deserving a break comes, which disrupts the usual flow of my day.
Usually, breaks are initiated through food. I will tend to keep my breaks solely for eating, that too only 10-15 minutes, I want to eat a bit less, as otherwise it makes me a lot 
lazy.

I have a list of a few things that might help me as well-
1- Coffee boosts my energy, increasing focus.
2- Water
3- Exercising thrice/4 times a week

Remember starting from tomorrow, all you should do is work.
