Git is powerful. My most impactful project till date revolves around introducing git to students. That makes me question, do ik git? So yeah, writing this as a nice brushup to what I already know related to Git. 

Some common commands  (very basic, even vibe coders should know) ->
- git init -> initialised a git repository,that means now your project is version controlled, inside it makes a .git folder which does all the magic.
- git add <filename or .(for every file changes)> -> adds files to staging area, if we don't add our changed files to staging area, git won't be able to know what all we changed. So any change we do needs to be added to the staging area for us to be able to keep its version's track 
- git commit -m"commit message" -> creates a snapshot of the project. At this time, your project looked like this. This is what commit does, snapshotting, plain and simple.
- git status -> files in the staging area
