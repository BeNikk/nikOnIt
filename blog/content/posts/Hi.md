I created this repo a long time back, because at odd times of the day or night,I want to write down things. I think it helps me think better.
This is just an introductory blog.  
<br/>
A brief introduction about myself - My name is Nikhil. I am developing software these days. Outside of work, I like to play cricket, speak at events and go for a run.  

I assume no one would be reading, or maybe few from github might?. But none the less, this would be my writing spot, in case I really feel like writing.
